soooooooooooooooooooo the goal of this fackin thing is sorting

-we take the set

we divide it into pairs in the unordered order the set was provided to us (first goes with second, third with fourth, fifth
with sixth...)

we find the largest element in each pair and put it in a main chain

we sort the main chain by recursively calling the algorithm
